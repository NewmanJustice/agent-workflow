# Business Context

This directory contains business context documents that help the AI agents understand your domain, stakeholders, and existing systems.

## What to include

- **Domain glossary** - Key terms and definitions specific to your business
- **Stakeholder information** - Who uses the system, their roles and needs
- **Existing system documentation** - Architecture diagrams, API docs, data models
- **Business rules** - Constraints, policies, and logic that govern the domain
- **Compliance requirements** - Regulatory or legal considerations
- **Integration points** - External systems and how they connect

## How agents use this

The agents (particularly Alex) reference these documents when:
- Creating system specifications
- Writing feature specifications
- Ensuring consistency with domain language
- Understanding constraints and dependencies

## Tips

- Keep documents concise and up-to-date
- Use markdown for consistency
- Link to external documentation rather than duplicating it
- Update as your understanding of the domain evolves
